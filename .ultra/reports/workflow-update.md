## User workflow update — 2026-09-26

User has changed reviewer allocation to conserve Codex quota. Complete the currently running phase-1 Sol rereview (same thread resumed after brief interruption). All SUBSEQUENT independent reviews/rereviews use fresh GLM-5.3-Flash CLI sessions with --effort max instead of Sol. Implementer remains GLM-5.3-Flash (--effort high unless user changes it); Astra only planning/orchestration. All work remains CLI dispatched. Independent read-only review domains may run concurrently against frozen source; implementation of dependent stages stays sequential and only one product writer at a time unless explicit disjoint-file ownership is planned. No self-review: reviewer must use fresh isolated context. Existing historical Sol reports remain valid evidence. This update supersedes old Sol-only language below/above.

## Latest user testing constraint — necessary tests only

User explicitly requests reducing excessive testing. Keep meaningful build, critical gameplay/rules/navigation checks, actual user startup, and targeted regression for changed behavior. Do not rerun an unchanged full suite, duplicate assertions, add implementation-mirroring tests, or broaden audits without a concrete remaining risk. Prefer a targeted case and stop once the relevant risk is resolved. Preserve required final acceptance (20 seeded bomb rounds, >=600 seconds actual rendering, dual-map HTTP/file workflows); run these once on the final candidate and repeat only affected evidence after fixes. Tests must remain honest and non-vacuous.

- User explicitly: parallelize everything safely parallelizable. Phase2 uses THREE disjoint CLI implementation workers (map, movement, integration preparation); after all finish, integration worker alone assembles/builds/tests. Independent review domains concurrently read frozen source. Do not parallelize colliding edits or claim intermediate incomplete builds validate integration.
